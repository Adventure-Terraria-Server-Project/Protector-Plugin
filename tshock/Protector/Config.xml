  Note that some tiles are handled differently than others:
    Protected pressure plates, switches, levers, timers, music boxes will not allow other players to trigger a 
    circuit or change their state.
    Protected chests will not allow other players to alter or view their content.
    Protected signs will not allow other players to edit them.
    Protected doors will not allow other players to open them (players can still pass through them though).
    Protected clay pots will not allow their plant to be removed by other players.
    Protected beds will still allow other players to set their spawn point, however, if
    "EnableBedSpawnProtection" is set to true, players will be prevented from actually spawning at or teleporting to them.
    
    Also, not all tiles can be shared, as a share does only allow "using" an object and not removing it, thus the only
    objects which can be shared are: pressure plates, switches, levers, timers, music boxes, chests, signs, tombstones, beds
    and doors.
    
  Protector is pretty smart in enforcing object protections, just some examples: If a torch is protected, the block it 
  is assigned to will not be removable either. If a pink vase put on a table is protected, the table can also not be removed 
  nor the blocks beneath the table. If a sapling gets protected, the tree growing out of it will inherit the protection.
  However, what protector can not handle are falling blocks like sand and silt or blocks removed by the game itself or 
  other plugins like ice blocks.

    The default setting covers:
    Most crafting stations, doors, chests, signs, pressure plates, levers, switches, timers, music boxes, pumps, piggy banks, 
    clay pots, safes, beds, statues, dart traps, water fountains, cannon, turret, teleporter, bubble machine, pumpkin, animal cages.
    
    NOTE: Players can not protect something inside of TShock regions they're not allowed to or if they have no build permission.

  <!-- 
    Tile types which are automatically protected on placement.
    
    The default setting covers: 
    Most crafting stations, chests, signs, levers, switches, timers, music boxes, beds, statues, pumps, water fountains, cannon, 
    turret, teleporter, bubble machine, pumpkin.
    
    NOTE: If you define a tile type in here but not in "ProtectableTiles", players will not be able to manually protect 
          this type of tile, i.e. they can not protect blocks placed by other players but are forced to place the blocks
          theirselfes in order to protect them.
          Auto protection is generally more restricted and smarter than manual protection. This is because a user can 
          manually protect a tile even if it is already protected by some other plugin (which Protector does not cooperate with)
          like Housing Districts, so the user can manually protect something inside houses they do not own. 
          However, this does not count for auto protection as other protection plugins will probably prevent players from 
          placing the tiles right away.

    The amount of chests which should be saved by Protector itself. Note that Protector chests are used only when the world's chest 
    limit (999) has been reached. Set to 0 if you don't want to make use of this feature.

    NOTE: Unlike Terraria world chests, Protector chests do not support naming and are stored in Protectors world metadata file, so
          if a plugin is not compatible with Protector, it will not be able to use the chest data of these chests as well as world editors
          will not be able to handle their data.

          The naming is limited because Terraria clients on their behalf can only store up to 1000 chest names. However, Protector prefers 
          storing named chests in the world data over unnamed chests - e.g. even if a chest is currently stored in Protectors data, once you 
          name it (and if there are not 999 named chests yet) it becomes a world chest and the previous unnamed world chest takes the data record
          of the Protector chest.
          This effectively yields only 999 possible named chests in your world no matter what number you configure here.

          Also note that you can always convert chests to world or Protector chests by using /swapchest.
          Use /protectioninfo to check whether a chest is stored by the world or Protector. Don't get confused here, chests must not be protected 
          at all to be stored by Protector, /pi is just the only way to display this info for the sake of developer laziness.
