  Note that some tiles are handled differently than others:
    Protected pressure plates, switches, levers, timers, music boxes will not allow other players to trigger a 
    circuit or change their state.
    Protected chests will not allow other players to alter or view their content.
    Protected signs will not allow other players to edit them.
    Protected doors will not allow other players to open them (players can still pass through them though).
    Protected clay pots will not allow their plant to be removed by other players.
    Protected beds will still allow other players to set their spawn point, however, if
    "EnableBedSpawnProtection" is set to true, players will be prevented from actually spawning at or teleporting to them.
    
    Also, not all tiles can be shared, as a share does only allow "using" an object and not removing it, thus the only
    objects which can be shared are: pressure plates, switches, levers, timers, music boxes, chests, signs, tombstones, beds
    and doors.
    
  Protector is pretty smart in enforcing object protections, just some examples: If a torch is protected, the block it 
  is assigned to will not be removable either. If a pink vase put on a table is protected, the table can also not be removed 
  nor the blocks beneath the table. If a sapling gets protected, the tree growing out of it will inherit the protection.
  However, what protector can not handle are falling blocks like sand and silt or blocks removed by the game itself or 
  other plugins like ice blocks.

    Tile types which can be manually protected by players.
    
    The default setting covers:
    Most crafting stations, doors, chests, signs, pressure plates, levers, switches, timers, music boxes, pumps, piggy banks, 
    clay pots, safes, beds, statues, dart traps, water fountains, cannon, turret, teleporter, bubble machine, pumpkin.
    
    NOTE: Players can not protect something inside of TShock regions they're not allowed to or if they have no build permission.

    Tile types which are automatically protected on placement.
    
    The default setting covers: 
    Most crafting stations, chests, signs, levers, switches, timers, music boxes, beds, statues, pumps, water fountains, cannon, 
    turret, teleporter, bubble machine, pumpkin.
    
    NOTE: If you define a tile type in here but not in "ProtectableTiles", players will not be able to manually protect 
          this type of tile, i.e. they can not protect blocks placed by other players but are forced to place the blocks
          theirselfes in order to protect them.
          Auto protection is generally more restricted and smarter than manual protection. This is because a user can 
          manually protect a tile even if it is already protected by some other plugin (which Protector does not cooperate with)
          like Housing Districts, so the user can manually protect something inside houses they do not own. 
          However, this does not count for auto protection as other protection plugins will probably prevent players from 
          placing the tiles right away.
