Protector Plugin
================================
 
###About

This plugin provides players on TShock driven Terraria servers the possibility of taking ownership of certain objects or blocks, so that other players can not change or use them.
The content of a protected chest can not be viewed or altered by other players, protected switches can not be hit by other players, signs can not be edited, beds can not be used, doors not opened and even plants in protected clay pots can not be harvested without owning the clay pot.

And if a player wants to access items of a friend's chest, then the owner of it shall share it with them. Protector offers sharing of protections directly to specific users, to TShock user groups or just to everyone - and it's the owner of the protection doing that, no administrative actions required.

Stay in control, you define which blocks or objects can be protected, are automatically protected on placement, can be deprotected, how many protections a player can create in general and what can be shared or not.

Furthermore, one might make use of Protector's special chest related features, like powerful Refill Chests allowing a timed refill of their content, restrict players from looting them more than one time or allowing only X times of lootings in total. 
Also, if your server happens to change worlds frequently or if you just want to offer your players to use chests which can be easily transported including their content, then you can allow the usage of so called Bank Chests storing their content world independently - imagine them as server sided piggy banks.

Usually Terraria worlds are limited to a maximum of 1000 chests. By using Protector you may bypass this limitation, check out the comments in the configuration file to see how this is done.

###How to Install

Note: This plugin requires Terraria Server API and TShock in order to work. You can not use this with a vanilla Terraria server.

Grab the latest release from [bin/Release](https://github.com/CoderCow/Protector-Plugin/tree/master/bin/Release) and put the _.dll_ files into your server's _ServerPlugins_ directory. Also put the contents of the _tshock/_ folder into your server's _tshock_ folder. You may change the configuration options to your needs by editing the _tshock/Protector/Config.xml_ file.
